But Facebook says it's harder to assign blame now than it was last year when the company discovered the IRA-linked accounts. In that case, the group got sloppy with its work, paying for ads in rubles and revealing its Russian IP addresses. The actors behind this campaign have used VPNs to hide their locations and paid third parties to purchase ads on their behalf. All together,the newly discovered pages and accounts bought 150 ads for approximately $11,000, the most recent of which was purchased in June 2018.

“We're still investigating what happened, but whoever created this network of accounts took a lot of effort to hide their real identity, so we don't yet know for certain who is responsible,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a separate post. “That said, some of this activity is similar to what the Internet Research Agency in Russia did before and after the 2016 US presidential elections.”

There are also some loose ties to the IRA. One known IRA account, for example, was briefly a co-administrator on one of the suspended pages. "We think that is interesting, but not determinative, which is why we wanted to publish our findings while not relying upon that to do attribution," said Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos.

The newly discovered network seems to have picked up right about the time the known IRA network fell silent. According to the ads published by the House Intelligence Committee earlier this year, the IRA pages that targeted the 2016 election began to taper off their advertising efforts in the spring of 2017. In this new network, the oldest page Facebook identified dates back to March 2017.
