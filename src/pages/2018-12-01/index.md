##Everyone is a designer. The design process has been democratised. Everyone is a part of it, consciously or not, every time they share their perspective. It is the collaboration between this panoply of perspectives and skills that can create beautiful design. 

Panop is a platform to share our own stories, contribute and engage with the design community. As we learn we want to share the skills and experiences of two friends in the industry, trading design romanticism for pragmatism instead. 

We've been working hard the past few months to build a website that we're proud of.

**'Articles'** are our own opinion pieces, exploring design for the everyday.

**'Reviews'** are just that - we'll write both traditional reviews and teardowns, sharing our own quality analysis of what makes products great.

**'Inspiration'** is work that we've noticed and appreciate throughout the design industry. 

**'Portfolio'** is our own, very best work. 

**'Store'** is a combination of our own stuff for sale and links to products that we love.

Stay tuned over the coming weeks as we begin to populate Panop. If you have any suggestions for what you'd like to see or hear [send us a message](mailto:caleb@panop.co "Email us"), or tweet at us [here](https://twitter.com/panop_co "Our twitter"). It could be a product you'd like to see reviewed, work you find inspiring or even something you'd like us to design.

##Panop!
